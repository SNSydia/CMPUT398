1. There are N floating point operations performed by the kernel as there are one operation performed for every pair of input elements.
2. There is 2N global memory reads preformed by the kernel as there is one operation performed for every input element. 
3. There are N global memory writes as there is one write for every floating point operation. 
4. there are 32144 bytes transfered from host to device, which equates to '2N * sizeof(float)' bytes on the system. This is because we are transfering both input arrays to the device, so the length of the transfered items is 2N.
5. There are 16072 bytes transfered from device to host, which equates to 'N * sizeof(float)' bytes on the system. This is because the output array length is length N due to N amount of floating point operations performed.
